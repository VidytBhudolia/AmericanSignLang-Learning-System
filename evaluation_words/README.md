# Evaluation Words

## Instructions

Place text files with words in this folder for the evaluation mode.

## File Format

- **Extension**: `.txt`
- **Content**: One word per line
- **Case**: Words will be automatically converted to uppercase
- **Length**: Recommended 5-7 letters per word for best experience

## Example File Structure

Create files like `words.txt`, `easy_words.txt`, `hard_words.txt`, etc.

### Example: `words.txt`
```
HELLO
WORLD
PEACE
LEARN
SIGN
```

### Example: `easy_words.txt`
```
CAT
DOG
SUN
MOON
STAR
```

### Example: `hard_words.txt`
```
LANGUAGE
PRACTICE
ALPHABET
EDUCATION
```

## How It Works

- All `.txt` files in this folder will be loaded
- Words are randomly selected during evaluation
- Students spell each word letter-by-letter using ASL
- Each correctly held letter adds to the score

## Tips for Word Selection

- **Easy words** (3-5 letters): Good for beginners
- **Medium words** (5-7 letters): Standard difficulty
- **Hard words** (8+ letters): Challenge mode
- Use common, meaningful words for better engagement
- Avoid words with special characters or numbers

## Default Words

If no files are found, the system uses these default words:
- HELLO, WORLD, PEACE, LEARN, SIGN, LANGUAGE, TEACH
